      Step 1: 
      First, you need to turn on your GPS for location sharing.

      Step 2: 
      Then, create an account!

      Step 3: 
      Input your personal details.

      Step 4: Add your destination address.
      Step 5: Once you are close to your destination, this app will share available parking spaces near your area
      Step 6: Once you find a place to park, click on the green button that says "I parked here!". You signal to the app that you've found a parking space successfully, and our app will store your parking location and help you when you need to find it later.
      Step 7: As a common cortesy, you can use the Red
          "Report Parking Spot" Button to share with other drivers where you see
          available parking spaces along the way.
      Step 8:
          Once you share available parking spots, over time, our app algorithm
          rewards members who help 10+ people find parking near their
          destination address. Through your support of others, we look to reward
          you, and we thank you in advance for your help.
