      Step 1: 
      First, you need to turn on your GPS for location sharing.

      Step 2: 
      Then, create an account!

      Step 3: 
      Input your personal details.

      Step 4: 
      Add your destination address.

      Step 5: 
      As you near your destination, this app will share available parking spaces available nearby.

      Step 6: 
      Once you are parked comfortably, click on the green button that says "I parked here!". 
      (You signal to the app that you've found a parking space successfully, and our app will store your parking location and help you when you need to find it later.)

      Step 7: 
      SHARE! As a cortesy, use the Red "Report Parking Spot" Button to share with other drivers where you see available parking spaces along the way.

      Step 8:
      Once you share available parking spots, over time, our app algorithm rewards members who help 10+ people find parking near their destination address. Through your support of others, we look to reward you, and we thank you in advance for your help.
